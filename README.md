This is a GitHub repository for COMP3015 Coursework 2: Optimised Developer Tool with Documentation


## How does the user interact with your executable? How do you open and control the software you wrote (exe file)?

## How does the program code work? How do the classes and functions fit together and who does what?

## What makes your shader program special and how does it compare to similar things? (Where did you get the idea from? What did you start with? How did you make yours unique? Did you start with a given shader/project?)
